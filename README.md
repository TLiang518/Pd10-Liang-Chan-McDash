Pd10-Liang-Chan-McDash
======================
Period 10 Terrance Liang and Michelle Chan \n
DinerDash simulation, but worse because its located in McDonalds. \n
The game involves four tables with a waiting area for incoming customers that come in every set period of time \n
The player acts as a waitor who walks to customers, guide them to tables and takes an order
The order is made in the kitchen and when ready, the waiter needs to go to the kitchen, get the order, and serve it.
After a period of time, the customer would've finished the food and the waiter needs to clear their table for the customer to leave. A set amount of points is gained after a successful serve. \n
If the waiter takes too long to guide a customer to a table, the customer loses happiness and would leave eventually, causing a deduction in the restaurant's popularity. \n
The game ends when popularity hits 0. \n
