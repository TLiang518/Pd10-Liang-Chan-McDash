HI MICHELLE!
feel better.
i set some bounds up but they are sort of incorrect because we didn't consider the image size, so the picture can move out of bounds
until the center of the pic hits it.
try to start setting the sizes of the pics
also, try incorporating some java stuff in it. make stuff interact!

Thanks!
-Terrance
