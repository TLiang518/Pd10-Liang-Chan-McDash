Hey Michelle, sorry for not being here today.
I found out last night that I had to leave periods at period 8 for ultimate. Sorry bout that.
I guess what you can do for now is either study processing and maybe start some coding or maybe write pseudocode for some basic stuff
like sending information between players and customers (getFood or sendFood(Customer) ) etc.

Sorry I'm not there. Message me on facebook if anything. I'll try to code over the weekend. If anything, I'll definitely do something on Memorial Day.

Sorry, 
Terrance
